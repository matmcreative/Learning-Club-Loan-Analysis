# Lending Club Loan Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict loan defaults using historical data from the Lending Club platform. Through comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of deep learning models, we seek to uncover patterns that predict loan repayment behaviors.

## Dataset
The dataset spans from 2007 to 2015, including borrower credit history, loan details, and repayment status. It's sourced from the Lending Club's loan data.

## Methods Used
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing distributions, correlations, and key statistics.
- **Feature Engineering:** Reducing dimensionality and selecting relevant features.
- **Modeling:** Implementing a neural network using Keras with TensorFlow as the backend.

## Results
The project successfully develops a model that can predict loan defaults with high accuracy. It also identifies key factors influencing loan repayment behaviors.

## How to Use
